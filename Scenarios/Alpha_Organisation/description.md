# Organisation Alpha

Alpha is a _fictional_ medical research organisation attempting to track the spread of diseases around the UK. They work with an international network of partner organisations to attempt to predict (and prevent) future pandemics. Alpha was set-up in a huge rush by the merger of several legacy organisations during the 2020 pandemic and their systems are a bit of a mess.

They've hired you to perform a security audit of their system. They want to know what they should be worried about; how worried they should be; and (hopefully) what they could do to fix it.

## Users

Alpha's systems have many different users. In addition to **staff** they work with **supporters**, **contributors**, and external **collaborators**. Each group uses slightly different use cases.

### Supporters & Contributors

Members of the public who believe in Alpha's mission and want to help. **Supporters** donate their time and money to the organisation to help it succeed. This includes fund raising activities, promotional events and a host of other activities.

**Contributors** are a primary source of data for Alpha. They provide regular updates on their health and well-being, both by submitting a daily update but also sharing biometric readings from smart devices directly with Alpha.

### Collaborators

**Collaborators** are scientists and partner organisations who share data and insights with Alpha. Alpha provides regular updates to the international community.

## Key Systems

Alpha has lots of different systems, but they've prepared an outline of the most important ones for you to consider. They are Eleos, Athena, Apollo and Cassandra. [You can find details about them in separate files here](./).
